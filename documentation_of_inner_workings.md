# NanOS: Documentation of Inner Workings

## 2025 Full ext2 Filesystem and Deployment Readiness

### Current Status: Production-Ready Filesystem
- **Complete writable ext2 support:**
  - Full POSIX-like file and directory operations (create, read, write, delete, modify)
  - Symbolic link creation, resolution, and display
  - Complete file permissions (rwx for user/group/other), ownership (uid/gid), and enforcement
  - File timestamps (atime, mtime, ctime) with automatic updates on access/modification
  - Robust error handling for all edge cases (out-of-space/inode, non-empty directories, invalid operations)
  - Large file support up to single indirect blocks (~12MB files)
  - Block and inode allocation/deallocation with bitmap management
  - Embedded ext2 filesystem image (262KB) with test files loaded at boot

### Production-Quality Shell (2024)

### Filesystem Architecture (Fully Implemented)
- **Multi-layer design:**
  - Block Device Layer: Abstract 512-byte block interface supporting multiple storage types
  - RAM Disk Implementation: 256KB in-memory storage for testing and embedded filesystem
  - ext2 Driver: Complete implementation supporting superblock, inodes, directories, files
  - VFS Layer: Unified filesystem API with path resolution, file operations, and error handling
  - Shell Integration: Direct filesystem command support with comprehensive error messages

### Current Limitations and Next Steps
- **Storage Limitation:** Currently uses RAM disk only - no persistent storage across reboots
- **File Size Limit:** Only single indirect blocks implemented (~12MB max file size)
- **No Hardware Storage:** Lacks ATA/IDE driver for actual hard drives/SSDs
- **Limited Metadata Sync:** Some superblock/group descriptor updates need atomic writeback
- **No Filesystem Checking:** Missing fsck functionality for corruption detection/repair

---

## NEXT MAJOR FEATURE: ATA/IDE Driver Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Why ATA/IDE Driver is Critical for Deployment
The current RAM disk implementation means all data is lost on reboot. For a production-ready OS, persistent storage is essential. An ATA/IDE driver will enable:

- **Persistent Storage:** Files and directories survive reboots
- **Real Hardware Support:** Boot from actual hard drives/SSDs  
- **Larger Storage Capacity:** Move beyond 256KB RAM disk limitation
- **Production Deployment:** Enable real-world usage scenarios
- **Data Integrity:** Permanent file storage and system persistence

### ATA/IDE Driver Implementation Plan
1. **Hardware Detection:** Detect ATA controllers and connected drives
2. **Basic I/O Operations:** Implement sector-level read/write operations
3. **Block Device Integration:** Connect ATA driver to existing block device layer
4. **Filesystem Migration:** Mount ext2 filesystem from ATA device instead of RAM disk
5. **Boot Integration:** Enable booting with persistent ext2 filesystem on IDE drive

### Implementation Requirements
- **PIO Mode Support:** Start with Programmed I/O mode for simplicity
- **Primary IDE Controller:** Support standard ISA IDE at 0x1F0-0x1F7
- **Master Drive Only:** Initially support only primary master drive
- **28-bit LBA Addressing:** Support drives up to 128GB
- **Error Handling:** Robust error detection and recovery
- **Integration:** Seamless replacement of RAM disk with persistent storage

### Expected Benefits Post-Implementation
- **True Persistence:** System state maintained across reboots
- **Real-World Usage:** OS becomes practically deployable
- **Larger Filesystems:** Support for gigabyte-scale storage
- **Development Platform:** Enable building larger software on the OS
- **Foundation for Growth:** Enable future features requiring persistent storage

## 2024 Writable ext2 and Shell Feature Summary

### Filesystem Features
- **Writable ext2 support:**
  - File and directory creation, deletion, and modification
  - Symbolic link creation and resolution
  - File permissions (rwx for user/group/other), ownership (uid/gid), and enforcement
  - File timestamps (atime, mtime, ctime) updated on access, modification, and metadata changes
  - Robust error handling for out-of-space/inode, non-empty directories, and invalid operations
  - Large file support (single indirect blocks, ~12MB max)
  - Block and inode allocation/deallocation with bitmap management

- `rm` cannot remove directories (use `rmdir`)
- `rmdir` only removes empty directories; non-empty gives an error
- Out-of-space/inode conditions are detected and reported
- Directory link counts and emptiness checks are enforced
- Symlinks are resolved in path lookups and shown in `ls`/`stat`
- Filesystem corruption detection and graceful degradation

### Known Limitations (To Be Addressed)
- **No persistent storage** - RAM disk only, data lost on reboot (ATA/IDE driver needed)
- **No double/triple indirect blocks** - limits files to ~12MB
- **No recursive remove** (`rm -r`) or file move/rename (`mv`) commands yet
- **No user mode** or real user/group separation (all actions as root)
- **No journaling** or filesystem checking (fsck) yet
- **Modern UI is disabled** by default and not a development concern
- **No support for mounting multiple filesystems** or devices beyond single root
- **No shell scripting** or command history features

### Future Plans (Post-ATA Implementation)
- Double/triple indirect blocks for large file support (>12MB)
- Filesystem checking and repair utilities (fsck)
- Recursive directory operations and file move/rename
- User mode, system calls, and process isolation
- Advanced shell features (history, scripting, tab completion)
- Multi-filesystem mounting and device management
- Performance optimizations and caching

## Common Error Messages

- `Error: Could not create file.` — File creation failed (out of space, invalid path, etc.)
- `Error: Could not delete file.` — File deletion failed (file does not exist, is a directory, or permission denied)
- `Error: Directory not empty.` — Attempted to remove a non-empty directory with `rmdir`
- `Error: Not a directory.` — Path is not a directory (for `rmdir`, `ls`, etc.)
- `Error: File does not exist.` — File not found (for `rm`, `cat`, etc.)
- `Error: Could not open file.` — File could not be opened (does not exist, permission denied, etc.)
- `Error: Write failed.` — File write operation failed (out of space, permission denied, etc.)
- `Unknown command: ...` — Command not recognized by the shell

## API Overview

- All VFS and ext2 public APIs are documented in their respective header files (`include/vfs.h`, `include/ext2.h`).
- All functions return `0` on success, `-1` on error, unless otherwise specified.
- Error codes are consistent and documented in the header comments.
- Parameter types use `const` for input-only pointers and `size_t` for sizes where appropriate.

---

## Overview
NanOS is a simple 32-bit x86 operating system kernel, designed to boot via GRUB using the Multiboot standard. It is written in C and x86 assembly, and provides basic kernel facilities such as GDT/IDT setup, interrupt/exception handling, and VGA text output.

---

## Boot Process and Architecture

1. **Bootloader and Multiboot Header**
   - The kernel is loaded by a Multiboot-compliant bootloader (e.g., GRUB).
   - `boot.s` contains the Multiboot header and sets up the initial stack.
   - Entry point is `_start`, which sets up the stack and calls `kernel_main`.
   - **Complexity:** The Multiboot header must be correctly aligned and located within the first 8 KiB of the kernel binary. Any misalignment or missing header will prevent GRUB from recognizing the kernel.

2. **Stack Setup**
   - A 16 KiB stack is allocated in `.bss`.
   - The stack pointer (`esp`) is set to the top of this stack before entering C code.
   - **Complexity:** If the stack is not properly aligned (16-byte alignment required), undefined behavior can occur, especially with GCC-generated code.

3. **Kernel Initialization (`kernel_main`)**
   - Initializes the VGA text terminal via `monitor_initialize()`.
   - Initializes the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) with `gdt_init()`.
   - Initializes the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) with `idt_init()`.
   - Enables interrupts with `sti`.
   - Enters an infinite loop.
   - **Complexity:** If any of these steps fail (e.g., GDT/IDT not loaded correctly), the system may hang, triple-fault, or fail to display output.

---

## Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
- Defined in `gdt.c`/`gdt.h` and loaded with `gdt_flush` (see `gdt_asm.s`).
- Sets up segment descriptors for kernel and user code/data.
- GDT entries:
  - 0: Null descriptor
  - 1: Kernel code
  - 2: Kernel data
  - 3: User code
  - 4: User data
- **Complexity:**
  - The GDT must be loaded before enabling protected mode features. If the segment selectors or access rights are incorrect, segment faults or privilege violations can occur.
  - The code assumes a flat memory model, but any deviation (e.g., incorrect base/limit) can cause subtle bugs.
  - The GDT is set up for user mode, but there is no code to switch to user mode, so these entries are unused.

---

## Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and Interrupt Handling
- Defined in `idt.c`/`idt.h` and loaded with `lidt`.
- 256 entries, each can point to an ISR or IRQ handler.
- ISRs (CPU exceptions) and IRQs (hardware interrupts) are defined in `idt_asm.s` using macros.
- Handlers:
  - ISRs: `isr0`-`isr31` (CPU exceptions)
  - IRQs: `irq0`-`irq15` (hardware interrupts, mapped to IDT entries 32-47)
  - `irq48` (IDT entry 80) is reserved, possibly for future system calls (not implemented).
- Handler flow:
  1. Hardware/CPU triggers interrupt.
  2. Assembly stub (from `idt_asm.s`) saves registers, sets up stack, and calls C handler (`isr_handler_next` or `irq_handler_next`).
  3. C handler checks for a registered handler, otherwise prints info to the monitor.
  4. End-of-interrupt (EOI) is sent to the PIC as needed.
- **Complexity:**
  - The IDT must be correctly loaded and all entries must be valid. A null or misconfigured entry will cause a triple fault (system reset).
  - The assembly stubs must preserve stack alignment and register state. Any mismatch between the stub and the C handler's expectations can corrupt the stack or registers.
  - The system enables interrupts (`sti`) after IDT setup, but if the PIC is not properly initialized or if spurious interrupts occur, the system may hang or behave unpredictably.
  - The code disables the PIT and masks most IRQs by default, so timer/keyboard interrupts are not handled unless code is uncommented and tested.

---

## Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)
- Initialization code in `pic.c` and `io.h`.
- Remaps IRQs to avoid conflicts with CPU exceptions.
- EOI is sent after handling IRQs.
- There are two PIC initialization routines: `pic_init()` (in `pic.c`) and `init_pic()` (in `io.h`), but only one is used at a time.
- **Complexity:**
  - If the PIC is not initialized or remapped correctly, hardware interrupts may not be delivered or may conflict with CPU exceptions.
  - The masking/unmasking of IRQs is critical. If all IRQs are masked, no hardware interrupts will be processed.
  - The code disables the PIT (timer) and masks IRQ0/IRQ1, so the system will not receive timer or keyboard interrupts unless this is changed.

---

## Terminal Output (VGA Text Mode)
- Implemented in `monitor.c`/`monitor.h`.
- Writes directly to VGA memory at `0xB8000`.
- Supports colored text, decimal/hex output, and simple formatted output.
- Used for kernel debugging and status messages.
- **Complexity:**
  - If the VGA buffer is not mapped or accessible (e.g., running in a VM with no VGA), no output will be visible.
  - The code does not handle scrolling or cursor management beyond simple wrapping, so output may be lost or overwritten.

---

## Linker Script
- `linker.ld` places code at 1 MiB, sets up sections for `.text`, `.rodata`, `.data`, `.bss`.
- Ensures Multiboot header is in the correct location.
- **Complexity:**
  - If the linker script is misconfigured, the Multiboot header may not be found, or sections may overlap/corrupt each other.
  - The entry point must match the boot assembly code.

---

## Build System
- `Makefile` uses a cross-compiler (`i686-elf-gcc`) and GNU tools.
- Produces `myos.bin` and a bootable ISO (`myos.iso`) for QEMU/GRUB.
- **Complexity:**
  - If the wrong compiler is used (not a cross-compiler), the binary may not run on real hardware or QEMU.
  - The Makefile does not enforce use of a cross-compiler beyond a runtime check in `kernel.c`.

---

## Complexities and Potential Failure Points

### 1. **Triple Faults and System Resets**
- If the GDT or IDT is not loaded correctly, or if an interrupt/exception occurs with a null or invalid handler, the CPU will triple fault and reset. This is a common failure mode in early OS development.

### 2. **Stack Alignment and Corruption**
- The stack must be 16-byte aligned for ABI compliance. If the stack pointer is misaligned, C code may crash or behave unpredictably, especially with newer GCC versions.
- The assembly stubs must match the calling convention expected by the C handlers. Any mismatch can corrupt the stack or registers.

### 3. **Interrupt Masking and PIC Configuration**
- If all IRQs are masked (as in the default code), no hardware interrupts will be delivered. This can make the system appear "dead" after boot.
- If the PIC is not remapped, hardware interrupts may conflict with CPU exceptions (e.g., IRQ0 at vector 8, which is a double fault).
- The code disables the PIT and masks IRQ0/IRQ1, so timer and keyboard interrupts are not processed by default.

### 4. **Monitor Output Not Visible**
- If running in an environment without VGA support, or if the VGA buffer is not mapped, no output will be visible, making debugging difficult.
- The monitor code does not handle scrolling, so output may disappear after 25 lines.

### 5. **Uncommented/Unused Code**
- There are commented-out sections for enabling the PIT and unmasking IRQs. If these are not enabled, the system will not process timer or keyboard interrupts.
- There are two PIC initialization routines, but only one should be used. Using both or neither can cause interrupt delivery issues.

### 6. **No User Mode or System Calls**
- The GDT has user mode entries, but there is no code to switch to user mode or handle system calls. Attempting to use these features will not work.

### 7. **No Exception Handling**
- Most ISRs simply print a message. If a critical exception occurs (e.g., page fault, general protection fault), the system will not recover or provide diagnostics beyond a simple message.

### 8. **No Paging or Memory Protection**
- All memory is identity-mapped and accessible. There is no protection from accidental or malicious memory access.

### 9. **No Device Drivers or File System**
- The kernel does not support any devices beyond the PIC and VGA. There is no file system, disk, or peripheral support.

### 10. **Build and Toolchain Issues**
- The Makefile does not enforce the use of a cross-compiler. If built with the host GCC, the binary may not work on QEMU or real hardware.
- The runtime check in `kernel.c` will abort if built on Linux, but this is not sufficient for robust builds.

---

## Notable Issues, TODOs, and Limitations (Expanded)
- **No system call or user mode transition support:** While GDT entries for user mode exist, there is no code for switching to user mode or handling system calls. Attempting to use these features will result in undefined behavior.
- **No process or memory management:** The kernel is single-tasking and does not implement paging or dynamic memory. Any memory corruption or stack overflow will crash the system.
- **No file system or device drivers:** Only basic PIC and VGA output are supported. There is no way to load or interact with files or devices.
- **Duplicate/unused code:** There are two PIC initialization routines (`pic_init` and `init_pic`), but only one is used. This can cause confusion and maintenance issues.
- **No exception handlers for most ISRs:** Unhandled exceptions are only printed to the monitor. There is no recovery or diagnostic mechanism.
- **No keyboard or timer handling enabled by default:** The code to unmask IRQ0/IRQ1 and set up the PIT is commented out. As a result, the system will not respond to keyboard input or timer interrupts.
- **No support for 64-bit or non-x86 architectures:** The code is hardcoded for 32-bit x86. Attempting to build or run on other architectures will fail.
- **No cross-compiler check at build time:** Only a runtime check in `kernel.c`. This can lead to subtle ABI or binary incompatibilities.
- **No paging or virtual memory:** All memory is physical and identity-mapped. There is no protection or isolation between kernel and (future) user code.
- **No userland or shell:** The kernel does not load or run user programs. There is no interface for user interaction beyond monitor output.
- **Potential for silent failure:** Many failure modes (e.g., triple fault, stack corruption) will result in a silent reset or hang, with no diagnostic output.

---

## Modular Driver System and Keyboard Input (2024 Update)

### Modular Driver System
- Drivers are registered via a C interface (`driver_t` struct) and can provide IRQ handlers, init, and shutdown routines.
- The kernel registers drivers explicitly in `kernel_main`.
- The driver registry is used to dispatch IRQs to the correct driver (e.g., keyboard on IRQ1).

### Keyboard Driver
- Handles US QWERTY scancode set 1, with support for both left/right shift keys.
- Implements a circular buffer for keystrokes, with API for reading buffered input.
- Handles backspace (removes last character from buffer and updates display), Enter (buffers `\n`), and ignores/control non-printable keys.
- Only printable characters, backspace, and Enter are buffered.
- Shift and uppercase/symbols are robustly handled.

### Modern UI Framework
- UI is toggleable at runtime via a boolean (`ui_modern_enabled`).
- Modern UI includes:
  - Status bar (top of screen) with system info
  - Panels for most recent interrupt, keystroke buffer, and (stub) system status
  - Visually distinct prompt area
- All output is routed through the UI layer when enabled; classic mode uses direct monitor output.
- Cursor position is always correct and the hardware VGA cursor is updated for a polished look.

### Cursor Handling
- `monitor_set_cursor` and `monitor_get_cursor` manage both the internal and hardware VGA cursor.
- Backspace works across lines and at line starts; cursor always follows the end of input.

---

## 2024 Memory Management and Heap System (Update)

### Memory Map
- Kernel loaded at 1 MiB (0x100000), sections: .text, .rodata, .data, .bss
- Heap starts at the end of the kernel image (symbol _end), size 128 KiB (configurable)
- Stack allocated in .bss, grows downward
- All dynamic allocations use the kernel heap

### Heap Design
- Free-list allocator: blocks are split and coalesced, supports kmalloc and kfree
- Alignment: 8 bytes
- Heap stats available: total, used, free
- Diagnostics panel in modern UI shows heap usage

### Dynamic Buffers
- Keyboard buffer and shell input buffer are dynamically allocated using kmalloc
- Buffer sizes are configurable at initialization
- Buffers are freed on shutdown or reallocation

### Heap Diagnostics UI
- When modern UI is enabled, a "Heap" panel shows total, used, and free heap space
- Useful for debugging and monitoring memory usage

---

## 2024 Paging System (Implemented)

### Paging Overview
- Paging is enabled early in kernel initialization, after GDT/IDT setup.
- The kernel identity-maps all memory required for the kernel image, heap, stack, and a buffer for future growth.
- The page directory and page tables are set up in C (`paging.c`/`paging.h`).
- The page fault handler (ISR 14) is registered and prints faulting address and error code.
- If a page fault occurs in the dynamic region (e.g., >= 0xC0000000), the handler allocates a new physical page using `kmalloc` and maps it to the faulting virtual address, allowing for dynamic memory growth and future user/kernel separation.
- If a page fault occurs outside the allowed region or if out of memory, the system halts for safety.

### Memory Map (Current)
- Kernel loaded at 1 MiB (0x100000), sections: .text, .rodata, .data, .bss
- Heap starts at the end of the kernel image (symbol _end), size 128 KiB (configurable)
- Stack allocated in .bss, grows downward from `stack_top` (16 KiB)
- All memory from 0x0 up to the highest of (kernel end + heap, stack top, stack bottom) plus a buffer is identity-mapped
- Dynamic region (e.g., >= 0xC0000000) is mapped on demand by the page fault handler

### Dynamic Page Mapping
- The kernel can now handle page faults for new virtual addresses in the dynamic region by allocating and mapping new pages on demand.
- This lays the groundwork for future features such as user processes, stacks, and advanced memory management.

### Modern UI Status
- The modern UI defined in `ui.c` is currently **DISABLED** by default and is not a concern for paging or memory management implementation at this stage.
- All paging and memory management work should focus on core kernel and memory, not UI features.

---

## 2024 Multiboot Memory Map and Dynamic Physical Memory Management (Update)

- The kernel now parses the Multiboot memory map provided by GRUB at boot.
- Only available (type=1) RAM regions are used for physical page allocation; reserved/unavailable regions are marked as used.
- The physical memory manager is initialized with the actual RAM size and layout, supporting any hardware/VM configuration.
- The boot sequence prints a clear, user-friendly summary of the memory map and detected RAM.

---

## 2024 Boot Sequence and Status Output (Update)

- The boot process now features a visually distinct banner and clear, formatted status messages for each major step (GDT, IDT, Paging, Heap, Physical Memory, Multiboot, Interrupts, etc.).
- The system prints a summary of the memory map, detected RAM, and indicates when it is ready for user input.
- This improves both developer experience and debugging.

---

## 2024 Roadmap: Next Features (Planned)

### 1. ext2 Filesystem Images (High Priority)
- **Load actual ext2 filesystem images:** Create or load real ext2 filesystem images into RAM disk
- **Test with real files:** Verify filesystem operations with actual files and directories
- **Initramfs integration:** Load filesystem images from initramfs or embedded data

### 2. IDE/ATA Driver (Medium Priority) 
- **Hardware storage support:** Replace RAM disk with actual disk storage
- **IDE/ATA interface:** Implement basic IDE/ATA driver for real storage devices
- **Persistent storage:** Enable loading filesystems from actual disks

### 3. Write Support (Medium Priority)
- **File creation:** Implement writing new files to ext2 filesystem

- **Command line parsing:** Better argument handling and options
- **Path navigation:** Support for `cd`, `pwd`, relative paths
- **Tab completion:** Filename completion for commands

### Modern UI Status
- **The modern UI defined in `ui.c` is currently DISABLED by default and is not a concern for current development.**
- All work should focus on core kernel, VFS, and storage features, not UI features.

---

## 2024 Roadmap: Writable ext2 Filesystem Support (Planned)

### Overview
- The next major feature is **writable ext2 filesystem support**.
- This will allow NanOS to create, modify, and delete files and directories on a real ext2 filesystem.
- Write support will enable a true persistent, interactive OS experience.

### Implementation Guidance
- Closely follow working OSDev examples and the ext2 specification for write operations.
- Implement file creation, deletion, and modification (including directory operations).
- Add shell commands for `touch`, `rm`, `mkdir`, and file redirection (e.g., `echo ... > file`).
- Ensure robust error handling and filesystem consistency.
- **The modern UI defined in `ui.c` is currently DISABLED and is not a concern for filesystem or ext2 implementation at this stage.**
- All work should focus on core kernel, VFS, and ext2 logic, not UI features.

### Rationale
- Writable ext2 support is a major step toward a real, usable OS.
- Enables persistent user data, configuration, and future userland programs.
- Lays the foundation for more advanced features (user mode, system calls, etc).

---

## 2024 ext2 Filesystem Support (Implemented)

### Overview
- **ext2 filesystem support** has been implemented in NanOS.
- The OS can now read files from a real, standard Unix-like filesystem.
- ext2 was chosen for its balance of simplicity, real-world features, and wide documentation/support in the OSDev community.

### Implementation Architecture
The ext2 implementation follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Block Device Layer (`blockdev.h/c`):**
   - Abstract interface for reading/writing blocks of data
   - Registry system for managing multiple block devices
   - 512-byte block size standard interface

2. **RAM Disk Implementation (`ramdisk.h/c`):**
   - Simple block device that stores data in allocated memory
   - Useful for testing filesystem without hardware drivers
   - Configurable size with 1MB default

3. **ext2 Structures (`ext2.h`):**
   - Complete ext2 filesystem data structures following the standard
   - Superblock, block group descriptors, inodes, directory entries
   - Proper packed structures for on-disk format compatibility

4. **ext2 Driver (`ext2.c`):**
   - Core ext2 filesystem implementation
   - Supports reading superblock, inodes, directories, and file data
   - Handles direct and single-indirect block addressing
   - Path resolution and directory traversal

5. **VFS Layer (`vfs.h/c`):**
   - Virtual filesystem interface providing unified API
   - Path resolution from root directory
   - File operations: open, close, read, seek
   - Directory operations: listing, stat information

6. **Shell Integration:**
   - Extended shell with filesystem commands: `ls`, `cat`, `stat`, `help`, `clear`
   - Commands work with VFS interface for filesystem operations
   - Error handling and user-friendly output

### Key Features
- **Read-only ext2 support:** Can read superblock, inodes, directories, and file data
- **Block device abstraction:** Clean interface for storage devices
- **RAM disk testing:** Simple block device for development and testing
- **VFS integration:** Unified interface for filesystem operations
- **Shell commands:** User-friendly interface for filesystem interaction
- **Error handling:** Robust error checking and user feedback

### Current Status
- The filesystem infrastructure is complete and functional
- Block device layer and RAM disk are working
- ext2 driver can parse filesystem structures
- VFS provides clean interface for applications
- Shell supports basic filesystem commands
- Ready for ext2 filesystem images to be loaded

### Limitations
- **Read-only:** Write support is planned and in progress
- **No ext2 image loaded:** System boots without an actual ext2 filesystem (unless embedded)
- **Single indirect only:** Double and triple indirect blocks not implemented
- **No symbolic links:** Symbolic link support not implemented
- **No permissions:** File permissions not enforced (read-only anyway)

### Future Enhancements
- Load actual ext2 filesystem images from initramfs or disk
- Implement write support for file creation and modification
- Add support for double and triple indirect blocks
- Implement symbolic link handling
- Add proper error handling for filesystem corruption
- Support for multiple filesystem types through VFS

### Testing
- Shell displays message about filesystem support on boot
- `help` command shows available filesystem commands
- Commands gracefully handle missing filesystem with informative errors
- Block device registry successfully registers RAM disk
- VFS layer properly initializes and integrates with kernel

### Modern UI Status
- **The modern UI defined in `ui.c` is currently DISABLED and was not a concern for filesystem implementation.**
- All work focused on core kernel, VFS, and ext2 logic as planned.

## Guidance for Future Development Prompts

When starting a new feature or chat, refer to this documentation for the current architecture, limitations, and roadmap. For example:

> "Refer to `documentation_of_inner_workings.md` for the current kernel architecture, driver system, and UI. I want to implement [next big feature] as described in the roadmap. Please design and implement it in a modular, maintainable way, and update the documentation as needed."

---

## Summary
This codebase is a minimal x86 kernel skeleton, suitable for learning about low-level OS development, bootloaders, and protected mode initialization. It is not a full-featured OS, but provides a solid foundation for further development (e.g., adding user mode, system calls, multitasking, memory management, and device drivers). 

**If the system is not working, the most likely causes are:**
- Incorrect Multiboot header or linker script
- GDT/IDT not loaded or misconfigured
- Stack misalignment or corruption
- All IRQs masked or PIC not initialized
- Running in an environment without VGA support
- Built with the wrong toolchain (not a cross-compiler)
- Unhandled exceptions or triple faults

Each of these areas should be carefully checked and debugged in order to bring the system to a working state. 

- The kernel now includes a modular physical memory manager, with a bitmap allocator and API for page allocation/freeing, integrated with the paging subsystem.
